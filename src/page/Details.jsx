        <h5 className='text-align-center'>
          Planning a trip can be easier through an online travel agency than if you handle each aspect of the planning separately.
          You can book hotels, air travel, rental cars, and more through a single site, and booking everything together sometimes results in discounts.
          By inputting a destination, a range of dates, and other preferences, you will see a list of options for each aspect of travel.
        </h5>
